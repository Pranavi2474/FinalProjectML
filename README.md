My final year Project 
XRP Crytpocurremcy Return Prediction 

XRP Cryptocurrency Return Prediction is a machine learning project 
aimed at forecasting the future returns of XRP (Ripple), one of the 
leading cryptocurrencies. The project involves collecting and analyzing 
historical market data to identify trends and patterns that can help in 
predicting short-term return fluctuations.

The project leverages Python along with libraries like Pandas and NumPy 
for data manipulation, and Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Randomforest, and 
potentially LSTM models for predictive modeling. Visualization tools such 
as Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to perform exploratory data analysis 
(EDA) and to compare actual vs predicted returns.

Key steps include data cleaning, feature engineering, building and 
evaluating machine learning models, and tuning hyperparameters for better 
performance. Various performance metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score are 
used to assess the models.

By comparing different models and visualizing the results, this project 
demonstrates a practical approach to financial time series forecasting. 
It also offers insights into the behavior of XRP's market trends and 
highlights the challenges and opportunities in applying ML to cryptocurrency 
prediction.
